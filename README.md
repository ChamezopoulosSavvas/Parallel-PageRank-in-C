# Parallel-PageRank-in-C

This is a mini project developed for the ECCE Auth course - Parallel and Distributed Systems

It is a simple parallel implementation of the PageRank algorithim developed initially by Google, utilizing the Gauss-Seidel Solve Method.

The parallelization is made using OpenMP, and a serial implementation of the algorithm is also included.
